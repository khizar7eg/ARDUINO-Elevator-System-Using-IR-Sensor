# ARDUINO-Elevator-System-Using-IR-Sensor
Arduino elevator system using IR sensor, simulated on Proteus software.

<strong>Instruction:</strong> Add the respective .hex file links to the Arduino and IR Sensors in Proteus before simulation.

The Project is designed in response to the following given problem:

As an Embedded System Design Engineer your task is to make a control system for Elevator to be installed in ground + 2 Floor building. You should complete your task with the following specifications:

<b>a.</b>	Up / down movement of Elevator is represented by DC Motor.<br>
<b>b.</b>	Opening & closing of Elevator door is represented by Motors M1, M2.<br>
<b>c.</b>	Buttons BG, B1, B2 are used to call the Elevator. Where BG is button on ground floor, B1 on 1st floor & B2 on 2nd floor.<br>
<b>d.</b>	Position of Elevator is detected using IR sensors installed on each floor.<br>
<b>e.</b>	Buttons BLG, BL1, BL2 are inside the elevator.<br>
<b>f.</b>	Seven Segment Display installed at each floor, which shows current position of Elevator.<br>

You are required to simulate the above task using proteus simulator. Choice of microcontroller (Arduino, AVR, and PIC) is up to you.
